# abc123

# This program adds the alphabets of a given string where A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.

# Inspiration for this program:

# THEREâ€™S A HADITH THAT SAYS: RASULULLAH (PBUH) SAID THAT ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT THERE WILL BE 73 STATES. 
# JEWS WILL BE IN THE 71ST STATE, CHRISTIANS WILL BE IN THE 72ND STATE AND THE MUSLIMS WILL BE WITH ME IN 
# PARADISE, THE 73RD STATE. SO WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBER 73? WELL, IF YOU ADD PARADISE 
# (P=16, A=1, R=18, A=1, D=4, I=9, S=19, AND E=5) YOU GET 73.
